## <a name="api-conventions"></a> API Conventions

This defines conventions used across the Access Control API.

### <a name="headers"></a> Headers

This defines common headers on the Access Control API.

#### <a name="content-type-header"></a> Content-Type Header

Content-Type is a standard HTTP header that specifies the content type of the body of the request. Access Control only supports `application/json` as the representation type for data.

#### <a name="authorization-header"></a> Authorization Header

All Access Control API operations require specifying a token.

An EDL token can be obtained from [Earthdata Login (EDL)](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov). The token should be specified using the `Authorization: Bearer` header followed by the EDL bearer token. For more information on obtaining an EDL bearer token, please reference the documentation [here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/for_users/user_token).

An example for generating a Launchpad token can he found [here](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/CMR/Example+Code+for+Requesting+Launchpad+Token). The token should be specified using the `Authorization:` header followed by the Launchpad token. More information on getting access to Launchpad tokens can be found on [this guide](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/CMR/Launchpad+Authentication+User%27s+Guide)

#### <a name="cmr-revision-id-header"></a> Cmr-Revision-Id Header

The revision id header allows specifying the revision id to use when saving the concept. It is optional for all ACL updates. The update will be rejected when:
1. The revision id specified is not an integer.
2. The revision id specified <= current revision id of the acl - a HTTP Status code of 409 will be returned indicating a conflict.

### <a name="responses"></a> Responses

### <a name="response-headers"></a> Response Headers

#### <a name="CMR-Request-Id-header"></a> cmr-request-id

This header returns the unique id assigned to the request. This can be used to help debug client errors. The value is a long string of the form

    828ef0b8-a876-4579-85db-3cc9d1b5f6e5

#### <a name="http-status-codes"></a> HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Description                                                                                                                                |

| 400         | Bad request. The body will contain errors.                                                                                                 |
| 404         | Not found. This could be returned either because the URL isn't known by access control or the item wasn't found.                           |
| 409         | Conflict. This is returned when a revision id conflict occurred while saving the item.                                                     |
| 415         | Unsupported Media Type. The body will return an error message that contains the list of supported formats.                                 |
| 422         | Unprocessable entity. Access control understood the request, but the concept failed ingest validation rules. The body will contain errors. |
| 500         | Internal error. Contact CMR Operations if this occurs.                                                                                     |
| 503         | Internal error because a service dependency is not available.                                                                              |

#### <a name="successful-responses"></a> Successful Responses

Successful responses will return an HTTP Status code of 200 and a body containing the CMR Concept Id of the item that was updated or deleted along with the revision id.

    {"concept_id":"AG12345-PROV","revision_id":1}

## <a name="acls"></a> Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) define permissions within the CMR. Everything is restricted in the CMR by default. ACLs give permission to specific users to take some action on some data.

Every ACL defines three parts like a simple sentence: subject, predicate, and object. The sentence "Science Users can view Provider FOO's granules" is an example. "Science Users" is the subject. "can view" is the predicate. "Provider FOO's granules" is the object.

ACLs are represented by JSON. If "Science Users" was an existing group defined in Provider FOO with concept id AG1234-FOO then an ACL granting that group access to view and order and guests permission to view FOO's granules would look like the following:

```
{
    "group_permissions": [{
        "group_id": "AG1234-FOO",          // Subject
        "permissions": ["read", "order"]   // Predicates
    }, {
        "user_type": "guest",              // Subject
        "permissions": ["read"]            // Predicates
    }],
    "catalog_item_identity": {             // Object
        "name": "All Granules",
        "provider_id": "FOO",
        "granule_applicable": true
    }
}
```

This is like a sentence saying "Science Users can view and order and Guests can view Provider FOO's granules."

The subject and predicate are in `group_permissions`. An ACL can identify multiple permissions per group. There can be multiple subjects and multiple predicates per subject in a single ACL.

By default, any provided `group_id` must be in the format of a CMR group concept_id. If the access-control configuration `allow-edl-groups` is set to `true`, then this validation will be bypassed.

Every ACL refers to an object called an "identity". The "identity" identifies what in the CMR is being granted permission by the the ACL. There are 4 kinds of identities:

* System Identities - Identifies a system level thing in the CMR.
* Provider Identities - Identifies a type of object owned by a specific provider.
* Single Instance Identities - Identifies a single instance of something in the CMR. Currently this only applies to managing specific groups.
* Catalog Item Identities - Identifies sets of catalog items (collections and granules) owned by a provider.

### ACL Uniqueness

ACLs are uniquely identified by their identity. There can only be one ACL to a specific identity. For example provider identities contain a provider id and a target. There can only be one ACL in the system for granting permissions to Provider FOO's Option Definitions. The rules for uniquely identifying each type is listed below.

* System Identities - Unique by target
* Provider Identities - Unique by provider id and target
* Single Instance Identities - Unique by target id (Group concept id)
* Catalog Item Identities - Unique by provider id and name.

### <a name="create-acl"></a> Create ACL

ACLs are created by POSTing a JSON representation of an ACL to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls` along with a valid EDL bearer token or Launchpad token. The response will contain a concept id identifying the ACL along with the ACL revision id.

#### Creating an ACL

```
curl -XPOST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" %CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls -d \
'{
    "group_permissions": [{
        "group_id": "AG1234-FOO",
        "permissions": ["read", "order"]
    }, {
        "user_type": "guest",
        "permissions": ["read"]
    }],
    "catalog_item_identity": {
        "name": "All Granules",
        "provider_id": "FOO",
        "granule_applicable": true
    }
}'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1

{"revision_id":1,"concept_id":"ACL1200000000-CMR"}
```

### Grantable Permissions

For system, provider, and single instance identities, the grantable permissions are limited by the target of the ACL.

### <a name="search-acls"></a> Search ACLs

ACLs can be searched for by sending a GET request to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls`, or a POST to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls/search`. A valid EDL bearer token or Launchpad token is required to search ACLs. If no token is supplied then guest permissions are used.

##### ACL Search Parameters

The following parameters are supported when searching for ACLs.

##### Standard Parameters:

* page_size
* page_num
* pretty
* include_full_acl - boolean parameter that indicates if the full acl details should be included in the search response.
* include_legacy_group_guid - boolean parameter that indicates if legacy group guid should be returned in place of group concept id in full acl search response. It can only be used when include_full_acl parameter is true.

##### ACL Matching Parameters

* permitted_group
  * options: ignore_case
* identity_type
  * options: none (always case-insensitive)
  * The type must be one or more of the following
    * system
    * provider
    * single_instance
    * catalog_item
* target
  * options: none (always case-insensitive)
  * Matches ACLs which have the given object identity target
* target_id
  * options: none (case-sensitive)
  * Matches single_instance ACLs through specified group target_id. Only applies when the single_instance target is GROUP_MANAGEMENT
  * identity_type=single_instance parameter is required alongside this parameter
* permitted_user
  * options: none (always case-insensitive)
  * user is a URS user name corresponding to a member of a group that has access to an ACL
* provider
  * options: ignore_case
  * Matches ACLs which reference a provider through a catalog item identity or a provider identity
* group_permission
  * options: none (always case-insensitive)
  * This is a nested parameter that has subfields 'permitted_group' and 'permission'; it can contain both subfields or just one
* permitted_concept_id
  * Matches ACLs that grant permission to the collection or granule with the given concept id
  * For an ACL to grant permission to a collection, the collection_applicable field of the ACL should be true and all the collection identifier filters (entry title, temporal and access value) of the ACL should match the related fields of the collection; no collection identifier defined in the ACL makes the ACL match all collections when its collection_applicable field is true.
  * For an ACL to grant permission to a granule, the granule_applicable field of the ACL should be true and both the granule identifier filters (temporal and access value), and collection identifier filters (entry title, temporal and access value) of the ACL should match the related fields of the granule and its parent collection.
* id
  * options: none (case-sensitive)
  * Matches either ACL concept ID or ACL legacy GUID

##### ACL Search Response

The response is always returned in JSON and includes the following parts.

* hits - How many total ACLs were found.
* took - How long the search took in milliseconds
* items - a list of the current page of ACLs with the following fields
  * concept_id
  * revision_id
  * name - This will be the catalog item identity name or a string containing "<identity type> - <target>". For example "System - PROVIDER"
  * identity_type - String of "provider", "system", "single_instance", or "catalog_item"
  * location - A URL to retrieve the ACL
  * acl - full JSON of the ACL. Included if `include_full_acl=true` parameter is set.

### <a name="retrieve-acl"></a> Retrieve ACL

A single ACL can be retrieved by sending a GET request to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls/<concept-id>` where `concept-id` is the concept id of the ACL returned when it was created.

Search parameter `include_legacy_group_guid`, which is a boolean parameter, can be used to indicate if legacy group guid should be returned in place of group concept id in the returned ACL.

```
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" %CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls/ACL1200000000-CMR?pretty=true

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "group_permissions" : [ {
    "group_id" : "AG1234-FOO",
    "permissions" : [ "read", "order" ]
  }, {
    "user_type" : "guest",
    "permissions" : [ "read" ]
  } ],
  "catalog_item_identity" : {
    "name" : "All Granules",
    "provider_id" : "FOO",
    "granule_applicable" : true
  }
}
```

### <a name="update-acl"></a> Update ACL

An ACL can be updated by sending a PUT request to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls/<concept-id>` where `concept-id` is the concept id of the ACL returned when it was created. `legacy-guid` field cannot be modified during update. The fields that uniquely identify an ACL cannot be updated, e.g. the `target` field of a system identity ACL. This limitation will eventually be removed as documented in CMR-3163.

```
curl -XPUT -i -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" %CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls/ACL1200000000-CMR -d \
'{
    "group_permissions": [{
        "group_id": "AG1234-FOO",
        "permissions": ["read", "order"]
    }, {
        "user_type": "guest",
        "permissions": ["read"]
    }],
    "catalog_item_identity": {
        "name": "All Granules",
        "provider_id": "FOO",
        "granule_applicable": true
    }
}'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1

{"revision_id":2,"concept_id":"ACL1200000000-CMR"}
```

### <a name="delete-acl"></a> Delete ACL

An ACL can be deleted with a DELETE request to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls/<concept-id>` where `concept-id` is the concept id of the ACL returned when it was created.

```
curl -XDELETE -i -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" %CMR-ENDPOINT%/acls/ACL1200000000-CMR

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 50

{"revision-id":3,"concept-id":"ACL1200000000-CMR"}
```

### <a name="get-permissions"></a> Checking User Permissions

You can check the permissions granted to a specific user or user type on specific concepts or system objects by making a GET request to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/permissions`.

The response is a JSON object mapping target ids to arrays of permissions granted to the specified user for the respective concept.

Example GET request:

```
curl -g -i -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" "%CMR-ENDPOINT%/permissions?user_type=guest&concept_id[]=C1200000000-PROV1&concept_id[]=C1200000001-PROV1"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1

{"C1200000000-PROV1": ["read"], "C1200000001-PROV1": []}
```

When requesting permissions for large sets of concept ids, you can make a POST request to `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/permissions` and pass the query parameters in URL encoded query string in the POST body.

Example POST request:

```
curl -i -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" "%CMR-ENDPOINT%/permissions" -d \
  'user_type=guest&concept_id=C1200000003-PROV1&concept_id=C1200000004-PROV1'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1

"C1200000003-PROV1: ["read"], "C1200000004-PROV1": ["read"]}
```

#### Parameters

* One of:
  * `concept_id` - Must be a valid concept id, or else use `concept_id[]=...&concept_id[]=...` to specify multiple concepts.
  * `system_object` - A system object identity target, e.g. "GROUP"
  * `provider` AND `target` - A provider id and a provider object identity target, e.g. "PROVIDER_HOLDINGS"
  * `target_group_id` - A single instance object identity target id, i.e. group concept id
* And one of:
  * `user_id` - The user whose permissions will be computed.
  * `user_type` - Either "guest" or "registered".
  * `page_size` - Size of page desired, only supported with concept_id.
  * `page_num` - Page number desired, only supported with concept_id.

### <a name="get-s3-buckets"></a> User Access to S3 Buckets

This endpoint will return a JSON list of S3 buckets a user has access to. If a list of providers is included in the request, the list of S3 buckets will be filtered to only include S3 buckets contained by collections within those providers.

#### Parameters

* Required:
  * `user_id` - The user whose available S3 buckets and object prefix names will be determined for.

* Optional
  * `provider[]` - A list of provider ids to filter the S3 bucket and object prefix names by. If not specified, all providers will be included.


Example request:
```
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" "%CMR-ENDPOINT%/s3-buckets?user_id=user1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 81
Content-Type: application/json

["s3","s3://aws.example-1.com","s3://aws.example-2.com","s3://aws.example-3.com"]
```


Example request with providers specified:
```
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" "%CMR-ENDPOINT%/s3-buckets?user_id=user1&provider[]=PROV2&provider[]=PROV3

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 51
Content-Type: application/json

["s3://aws.example-2.com","s3://aws.example-3.com"]
```


### <a name="application-health"></a> Application Health

This will report the current health of the application. It checks all resources and services used by the application and reports their health status in the response body in JSON format. The report includes an "ok?" status and a "problem" field for each resource. The report includes an overall "ok?" status and health reports for each of a service's dependencies. It returns HTTP status code 200 when the application is healthy, which means all its interfacing resources and services are healthy; or HTTP status code 503 when one of the resources or services is not healthy. It also takes pretty parameter for pretty printing the response.

    curl -i -XGET %CMR-ENDPOINT%/health?pretty=true

Example healthy response body:

```
{
  "echo" : {
    "ok?" : true
  },
  "metadata-db" : {
    "ok?" : true,
    "dependencies" : {
      "oracle" : {
        "ok?" : true
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example unhealthy response body:

```
{
  "echo" : {
    "ok?" : true
  },
  "metadata-db" : {
    "ok?" : false,
    "dependencies" : {
      "oracle" : {
        "ok?" : false,
        "problem" : "Exception occurred while getting connection: oracle.ucp.UniversalConnectionPoolException: Cannot get Connection from Datasource: java.sql.SQLRecoverableException: IO Error: The Network Adapter could not establish the connection"
      },
      "echo" : {
        "ok?" : true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
